# cipher_playground
A Python-based interactive demo of the cipher with detailed explanations and user-driven encryption/decryption.


# Vigenere Playground

This project is an educational implementation of the **Vigenère cipher**, a classical polyalphabetic substitution cipher.  
It is designed as an interactive playground: you first see a working example, then try encrypting and decrypting your own phrases with your chosen key.  

## Features
- Clean, well-documented Python code with step-by-step inline explanations.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers).
- Demonstrates both **encryption** and **decryption** in one run.
- Interactive input: users can supply their own phrase and key.
- Easy to extend for experiments with other ciphers.

## Why This Project
The Vigenère cipher is historically important. It was considered “unbreakable” for centuries, before cryptanalysis methods like frequency analysis and the Kasiski examination proved otherwise. This project is **not** meant for real-world security, but as a teaching tool for:
- Understanding how polyalphabetic substitution works.
- Practicing modular arithmetic in cryptography.
- Experimenting with Python string manipulation.
